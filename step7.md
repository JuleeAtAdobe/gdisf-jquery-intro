In this exercise, you'll try out using several JS widget APIs to bring more
functionality into the webpage.

Go through these steps, and do as many as you can in the time we have:

1) Start with step6_solution.html, or start with your own solution from step 6. Open it up and make sure it's working as expected.

2) Go to https://developers.google.com/+/plugins/+1button/ and generate the code for a Google+ button with no annotation and a medium small size. Insert that so it shows up next to the header of the webpage.

3) Go to https://dev.twitter.com/docs/tweet-button and read about the Tweet button. Find the HTML/SCRIPT tag for adding it, and paste that into your webpage, at the bottom near the counter.

4) Modify the share URL or HTML according to the docs to specify hash tags and change it so that it doesn't show the counter.

Bonus: Using JavaScript, generate a Tweet button for each video, and display it when the video is clicked. The text for each tweet button should be the video title.

Make sure that you use your browser developer tools to make debugging easier
while working on this. Check for errors, and use console.log() to figure out
how far your code makes it, and what the values of your variables are along the way.
