In this exercise, you will use jQuery to manipulate the web page
instead of "raw JavaScript".

First, add a <script> tag to the page which loads in the jQuery library,
which you'll find in the lib folder of the project.

Next, replace the existing code with jQuery - any DOM manipulation can be done
with jQuery instead.
If you're not sure how to do something with jQuery, google for "X with jQuery"
and you will likely find the jQuery docs or StackOverflow questions.

Make sure that you use your browser developer tools to make debugging easier
while working on this. Check for errors, and use console.log() to figure out
how far your code makes it, and what the values of your variables are along the way.
